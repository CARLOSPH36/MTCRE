ROUTE TABLE COLOR INFORMATION:
BLACK are currently active and will forward traffic.
BLUE are not active, but may become active if the current active route becomes inactive.
GREY have been disable and will not be used.
------------------------------------------------
ROUTE DISTANCE:
Conected route distance is 0
Static route distance is 1 by default, unless changed by administrator.
Routes that are changed to 255 will no be routed at all.
* Longest Prefix-Match
------------------------------------------------
Default ROUTE:
0.0.0.0/0 
- This means that all traffic will be routed out to this gateway if no route are matched.
- If no default route exists packets are simple dropped by the router.

------------------------------------------------
OSPF
- Link state protocol
- Interior Gateway Protocol(IGP).
- Administrative Distance 110 and give the "o" flag.
- Use multicast address 224.0.0.5 and 224.0.0.6
- Best path selection using Shortes Path First(SPF) algorith(also refered as Djikstra algorith). The path
	with the least total cost(lowest OSPF metric)will be installed on routing table.

* There is NO "main" Router in OSPF network.
* The download path may be different than the upload path.
* One of the common mistakes is to check the paths from one side only. You should look at the paths from both sides.


OSPF Network Types

network-type (broadcast | nbma | point-to-point | ptmp; Default: broadcast)
* Broadcast and the nbma types elect a designated router(DR) and a BDR, the point-to-point and the ptmp DOES NOT.

*

DR and BDR:
The designated Router(DR) and the BDR are useful when you have multiple(more than two) OSPF routers in the same Layer 2 broadcast domain,
to reduce the OSPF traffic.
* We do not need a DR and BDR between just two routers.
The point-to-point is a network type that will run OSPF between two routers only and does not elect designated router.
[The DR maintains a complete topology table of the network and sends updates to the other routers participating in OSPF updates]

* OSPF Extra Tips:
Its quite easy to use two OSPF path as: faileover.

HOW OSPF WORKS:
1. Establish neighbor relationship between routers(OSPF adjency).
2. Exchange database description, Link-State Request & Link-State Update.
3. Build Link-State Database(LSDB).
4. Build Shortes Path First tree, based on LSDB.
5. Calculate Shortes path using Djikstra algorith.
6. Installing best-path route in routing table.

ROUTERS TYPES:
- Internal Router(IR).
- Area Border Router(ABR).
- Autonomous System Boundary Router(ASBR).
- Designated Router(DR).
- Backup Designated Router(BDR).

OSPF PACKETS:
- Hello.
- Database Description(DD).
- Link State Request(LSR).
- Link State Update(LSU).
- Link State Acknowledge(LSAck).




------------------------------------------------
THE BACKBONE AREA:
The backbone area(area-id=0.0.0.0)forms the core of the OSPF network.

* Mikrotik recomienda poner un maximo de 80 routers por area.
